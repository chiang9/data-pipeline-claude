# **Product Requirements Document: Data Pipeline Module (Proof of Concept)**

## **1\. Introduction**

This document outlines the product requirements for a Proof of Concept (POC) of a flexible data pipeline module. The primary goal of this POC is to demonstrate the core capability of ingesting data from a specified source, processing it through a placeholder transformation layer, and loading it into a target database. This initial phase will focus on a minimal viable pipeline to validate the architectural approach and establish foundational components for future expansion.

## **2\. Goals**

The main goals for this POC are:

* **Validate Core Data Flow:** Prove that data can be successfully ingested from a source, passed through a processing layer, and loaded into a destination.  
* **Establish Foundational Codebase:** Create a modular and extensible structure for future development.  
* **Identify Initial Technical Challenges:** Uncover any immediate technical hurdles related to CSV parsing, MySQL interaction, or basic pipeline orchestration.  
* **Inform Future Development:** Provide a clear understanding of the effort and approach required for expanding the pipeline's capabilities.

## **3\. Key Features (POC Scope)**

### **3.1. Data Source Ingestion**

* **Requirement:** The module shall be capable of ingesting data from a source file.  
* **Current Scope (POC):**  
  * **Format:** Only Comma Separated Values (CSV) files will be supported as the input format.  
  * **Input Mechanism:** The module will accept a file path to the CSV file.  
  * **Error Handling:** Basic error handling for file not found or unreadable files.

### **3.2. Transformation Layer (Placeholder)**

* **Requirement:** The module shall include a dedicated layer for data transformation.  
* **Current Scope (POC):**  
  * **Functionality:** For this POC, the transformation layer will be a pass-through. No actual data manipulation or transformation will occur.  
  * **Modularity:** The design should allow for easy integration of complex transformation logic in future iterations. This means the transformation logic should be encapsulated in a separate, identifiable module or function.

### **3.3. Data Destination Output**

* **Requirement:** The module shall be capable of outputting processed data to a target database.  
* **Current Scope (POC):**  
  * **Database Type:** Only MySQL will be supported as the output destination.  
  * **Table Creation/Update:** The module should be able to create a new table if it doesn't exist or append data to an existing table. The schema will be inferred from the CSV header for basic types (e.g., all columns treated as VARCHAR for simplicity in POC, or basic type inference if straightforward).  
  * **Connection:** Database connection details (host, port, user, password, database name) will be configurable.  
  * **Error Handling:** Basic error handling for database connection failures or write errors.

## **4\. Future Considerations (Beyond POC)**

These features are explicitly out of scope for the current POC but are important for the module's long-term vision.

### **4.1. Multiple Data Sources**

* **Future Formats:** Support for other common data formats such as JSON, XML, Parquet, Avro.  
* **Future Connectors:** Integration with various data sources like APIs, cloud storage (S3, GCS), message queues (Kafka), or other databases (PostgreSQL, SQL Server).

### **4.2. Multiple Data Destinations**

* **Future Databases:** Support for outputting to other relational databases (PostgreSQL, SQL Server) or NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra).  
* **Future Destinations:** Output to data lakes, data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery), or message queues.

### **4.3. Advanced Transformation Layer**

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, data type conversions, outlier detection.  
* **Data Enrichment:** Joining with other datasets, adding derived columns.  
* **Data Aggregation:** Summarizing data, calculating metrics.  
* **Data Validation:** Implementing rules to ensure data quality and integrity.

## **5\. Non-Functional Requirements**

* **Performance (POC):** The POC should demonstrate reasonable performance for typical CSV file sizes (e.g., up to 10,000 rows). Specific benchmarks are not required at this stage.  
* **Error Handling:** Robust error logging and graceful failure mechanisms should be implemented. Detailed error messages should be provided for debugging.  
* **Modularity:** The codebase should be well-structured, allowing for easy addition of new data sources, transformations, and destinations without significant refactoring of existing components.  
* **Configuration:** All external dependencies (file paths, database credentials) should be configurable, ideally through environment variables or a configuration file.  
* **Security (POC):** Basic security considerations for database credentials (e.g., not hardcoding them).

## **6\. Technical Considerations (High-Level)**

* **Programming Language:** Python is the preferred language due to its rich ecosystem for data processing.  
* **Libraries:**  
  * pandas for CSV reading and initial data handling.  
  * mysql-connector-python or SQLAlchemy for MySQL interaction.  
* **Execution:** The module should be runnable as a standalone script or function.

## **7\. Success Metrics (for POC)**

The POC will be considered successful if:

* A CSV file can be successfully read and its data extracted.  
* The extracted data can be loaded into a MySQL table without errors.  
* The transformation layer acts as a transparent pass-through.  
* The code demonstrates a clear separation of concerns, making it extensible.  
* Basic error scenarios (e.g., invalid file path, database connection issues) are handled gracefully.
